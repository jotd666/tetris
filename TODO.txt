- 50Hz => 60Hz
- amiga replay speed is a several times slower!
- advancing lines: random not so good/similar to POKEY random (one almost filled line each time)
  ASLR generators temp 128k already generated & test. If works then code it to save memory
  => ok but should pick numbers in irq to make generator faster
- floppy A1200 nofast: continue screen crashes with 800004 GURU: retest

- save highscores


low pri:

- insert coin timer when continue screen should be 0
- log used tiles to reduce memory size
- simulate service mode to allow some settings: difficulty is the only interesting setting

converter:

- subx: replace by one of SBC macros!
- cmp: add a FIX_CMP_CARRY after each one: INVERT_C + SET_X_FROM_C
- cmp + bmi??
- after a subx: add INVERT_XC_FLAGS
- sec/clc + dex/dec + adc/sbc sandwich
- php+sei => review
- grouping of simple shifts from 68k code
